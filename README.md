# Microtome

Microtome is a gpu accelerated model slicer intended for generating slice images for
use in DLP style 3D printers. Eventually it will be expanded to control 3D printers
using Chrome App serial port support

# Status

I am currently in the process of porting Microtome from Dart to Typescript. This is being done due to various
issues with the Dart platform and Chrome Apps; specifically in the mistaken belief to make it more "secure", inter
window communication even inside a self-contained chrome app is severely crippled.
