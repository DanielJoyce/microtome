Eventually it will be expanded to control 3D printers\r\nusing Chrome App serial port support\r\n\r\n# Status\r\n\r\nI am currently in the process of porting Microtome from Dart to Typescript. This is being done due to various\r\nissues with the Dart platform and Chrome Apps; specifically in the mistaken belief to make it more \"secure\", inter\r\nwindow communication even inside a self-contained chrome app is severely crippled.\r\n\r\n- [X] For z axis change pitch to lead as its what really matters\r\n- [ ] Slice to zip file via zipjs and filejs, create a download containing PNG slices\r\n- [X] Enable scrollwheel in slice preview\r\n- [ ] Add Job configuration object\r\n  - [ ] Specify slice thickness as multiples of minimum printer slice\r\n  - [X] Job name\r\n  - [X] Job desc\r\n  - [X] Layer exposure times\r\n  - [X] Layer blank / move times\r\n  - [ ] Job length estimate\r\n  - [X] Specify raft thickness\r\n  - [X] Specify initial z-offset offset for all loaded meshes\r\n  - [ ] Export/Import job spec\r\n- [ ] Slice shader improvements\r\n  - [ ] Specify thickness of support grind in mm\r\n  - [ ] Specify support cube lattice spacing in mm\r\n  - [ ] Allow rotation of support cube matrix\r\n  - [ ] Generate raft\r\n  - [ ] Support multi-step layer exposure patterns to reduce heat generation for large slice areas.\r\n- [ ] Print volume preview\r\n  - [ ] Move\r\n  - [ ] Rotate\r\n  - [ ] Scale\r\n  - [ ] Select\r\n  - [ ] Add\r\n  - [ ] Delete\r\n  - [ ] Copy\r\n- [ ] Export / Import project\r\n  - [ ] Job settings\r\n  - [ ] Printer config\r\n  - [ ] Current project layout\r\n- [ ] Support generation improvements\r\n  - [ ] Find low points that need support\r\n  - [ ] Find other flat areas requiring support\r\n  - [ ] Sample randomly, then use s-hull to create dealauny triangulation\r\n  - [ ] Use delauny triangulation then as support pattern.\r\n\r\n## Future Directions\r\n\r\n- Generate paths for conventional printers via potracing the slice images?\r\n  - https://github.com/kilobtye/potrace  \r\n  - Seems to be a recent port and works well.\r\n- Mesh union\r\n- Mesh repair utilities\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
